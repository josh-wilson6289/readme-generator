  ## Description
  This project makes creating a README file easier for developers.  It prompts the user for information about the project using Inquirer and then creates a README.md file using fs writeToFile. 

  ## Installation
  This project uses Inquire and Validator, so those NPM packages must be installed before running the file.

  ## Usage
  Simply run the index.js file, answer the questions, and a README is generated for you in the Generated-README folder.
